        <h1>Δ Psychocivic framework for thought</h1>
        
            <p><span>Our cities affect our psychology. Exactly in what ways living in cities affects our mind and behaviour however is not clear. I think that we do not have a good mental framework for thinking about the psychological effects of cities so I have designed what I call the psychocivic framework for thought. <a class="internal" data-uuid="FnSofJVE" href="/FnSofJVE">A framework for structuring thought is also a framework for asking good questions</a>.</span></p>

            <p><span>The psychocivic framework for thought is made up of 4 parts:<ul><li>Function: The systems which enable urban spaces to exist</li><li>Space: Indoor, outdoor, and digital layers of the city</li><li>Experience: Sensory experience of the space</li><li>Psyche: Anything relating to the mind</li></ul></span></p>
        
            <p><span>The goal is that by using this framework to structure any thinking around cities, the psychological effects and phenomena may be observed more closely. This model puts our internal experience as a high priority in thinking about the design of the space and systems of a city.</span></p>
