                <p class="backlink-text">When I reflect upon my own learning experiences, most of what I've learnt has arisen directly out of personal projects. I strongly believe this should be the guiding principle of education, Education should nurture people to develop their own projects, research, and ideas. As well to connect peers to review and give each other feedback on their work so that they can grow together.</p>
