        <h1>Personal projects structure learning and engagement</h1>
        
            <p><span>Most mediums are not inherently engaging. Reading, watching and consuming content is typically a passive cycle. The level of engagement with material depends on each individual reader. The problem perhaps is when there is no reason to engage, no goal or structure through which to engage (<a class="internal" data-uuid="V42qDrst" href="/V42qDrst">Three engagement factors</a>). </span></p>
        
            <p><span>Personal projects solve this. When working on a project, reading and researching become steps towards a bigger goal or motivation. That which was previously passive content forms a new meaning as being a tool for bringing you closer to this goal. Similarly <a class="internal" data-uuid="mGB7thFQ" href="/mGB7thFQ">Games are inherently engaging mediums</a> because they give the player a goal along with tools to work towards that goal.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>When I reflect upon my own learning experiences, most of what I've learnt has arisen directly out of personal projects. I strongly believe this should be the guiding principle of education, <a class="internal" data-uuid="GCMWx3Ui" href="/GCMWx3Ui">Education should nurture people to develop their own projects, research, and ideas</a>. As well to connect peers to review and give each other feedback on their work so that they can grow together.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>What does this entail for reading and writing? Perhaps when I read a book I should have a project in mind, or first create a plan of what I hope to get out of it. Through writing can you perhaps structure micro-projects for engagement? Or perhaps tell the reader to not continue unless they have a specific project in mind? Or bring the reader into a larger, communal project, shared across every reader of the book?</span></p>

                <p class="backlink-text">Static media often provide only one engagement factor at a time. If you read a book that gives writing advice (tools), but you do not have a goal in mind to write something you may not internalise the advice well, or only later engage with it. However if you have a project that you're working on (a goal) then a book related to this project will give you either the space or the tools to reach towards your goals (Personal projects structure learning and engagement).</p>

                <p class="backlink-text">Education systems are moving towards more active forms of instruction, and while this is a step in the right direction it is not sufficient. For the active instruction is designed within a passive system. To truly give students agency over their own learning, they need to create their own learning experiences: Personal projects structure learning and engagement.</p>
