            <p><span>In circling around the question "what is engagement?" I have come up with <a class="internal" data-uuid="nJHwBEjP" href="/nJHwBEjP">Three approaches to engagement</a> which are each formed of two out of <a class="internal" data-uuid="V42qDrst" href="/V42qDrst">Three engagement factors</a>: goal, space, or verb. I further hypothesise that these three approaches to engagement come together to form a cycle of engagement which underlies not only why <a class="internal" data-uuid="mGB7thFQ" href="/mGB7thFQ">Games are inherently engaging mediums</a> but also any creative work.

                <p class="backlink-text">This same Cycle of Engagement can be applied to just about any creative endeavour or engaging experience.
